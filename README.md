# BrainTrainer
"Brain Trainer" is an Android application with simple game where the player will have to answer to simple mathematical questions within 30 seconds. The player can repeat the game as much he/she wants. Currently all questions are based on simple additions only. This application was developed as a test project only &amp; I will update the application in future.
